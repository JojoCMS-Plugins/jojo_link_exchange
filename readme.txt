Directory options found on the admin screen - customise, options, category of SEO (domain.com/admin/options

It is possible that directories using the words directory, resources, or links may not get good Google PR on the page.

We recommend that you use the option to change from the default /directory/, and /directory-listing to say /sites/ and /sites-listing/, or /interest/ and /site-of-interest/

There is also an option to have a direct link from the category pages to the linked site, or to have each listing with their own page (default)

Please add link text and a description for inbound links to use to link through to you - we recommend that you change this occasionally, so people are not continually using the same link text and descriptions to refer to your website.
